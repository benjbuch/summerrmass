`summerrmass` collects functions and workflows to batch-process MALDI
spectra. This includes (1) to automatically collect the data distributed
across various folders, (2) pre-porcess the imported spectra, (3)
extract the peak intensities at given m/z ratios of interest in a
semi-automated manner, (4) combine the collected data with the
experimental metadata, and (5) conduct further downstream analysis.
